You will meet with Matt Moran, CTO, and other members of the development team, and the format of the interview (3 parts) is below. We would like the solution to the code pairing at least a day before your scheduled interview slot.
1. Code pairing exercise
You can find the exercise we would like you to complete here:
https://github.com/kiyanwang/exercises/blob/main/simple-linked-list.zip
Please download that zip file, extract it, and complete the exercise locally on your machine. The README.md describes the nature of the problem. We've provided a test suite to validate your solution against. Your task is to understand the problem and implement a solution that makes the tests pass.
The HELP.md file should provide all the information you need to get up and running.
The two files you'll be most interested in are:
simple-linked-list.js: add your code to this file
simple-linked-list.spec.js : this file contains the tests, any test function prefixed with an 'x' is disabled. Simply remove the 'x' to include that test.
If you have any questions please reach out to Nadeem.
Please submit your solution to us 24 hours before your scheduled interview. You can submit it via email (just zip up the two files listed above and email to Nadeem), or push your solution to a public git repo and send us the link. We will ask you to talk through your solution during the interview and to pair with a couple of us to extend it, so please be ready to screen share and edit your solution.
The interview will be on Google meet, so pls bear in mind that if you are on a Mac, then OSX needs permissions to screen share. We recommend you test Google Meet screen share on your computer before your interview.
2. Onboarding Discussion - Here you'll meet at least one of our recent hires who will describe their experience(s) during their onboarding process and give you an opportunity to learn more about how that works, what its like working here, and give you the opportunity to ask questions you might have.
3. Team/Cultural chat. Here we'll ask you questions about team building and team work share some our values with you and try to learn more about yours.
At the end you'll get back together with the entire panel, and give you an opportunity to question us.
Please feel free to get in touch with Nadeem Shabir (nadeem.shabir@technologyfromsage.com) if you have any questions.
