export class Element { - This line defines a new class called Element which we will use to represent individual elements(also known as nodes) in our linked list.
constructor(value) { - This is the constructor method for the Element class. It takes a single argument,in this case it is value. It sets it as the _value property of the new element object and also sets the _next property to null.
get value() { - This is a getter method that returns the _value property of the element object.
get next() { - This is a getter method that returns the _next property of the element object.
set next(next) { - This is a setter method that takes a single argument, next, and sets it as the _next property of the element object.

export class List { - This line defines a new class called List which we will use to represent the linked list data structure.
constructor(arr) { - This is the constructor method for the List class. It takes a single argument, arr, which is an optional array of values that we want to initialize our linked list with. It sets the initial length of the list to 0 and the _head property to null.
if (Array.isArray(arr) && arr.length > 0) { - This line checks if the arr argument is an array and has at least one element. If this condition is true, we initialize the linked list with the values in the arr array.
this._head = new Element(arr[arr.length - 1]); - This line creates a new Element object with the value of the last element in the arr array and sets it as the _head of the linked list.
let current = this._head; - This line creates a new variable called current and sets it to the _head of the linked list.
for (let i = arr.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) { - This line starts a loop that iterates over the remaining elements in the arr array, starting from the second to last element and going backwards.
current.next = new Element(arr[i]); - This line creates a new Element object with the value of the current element in the arr array and sets it as the next property of the current Element object.
current = current.next; - This line updates the current variable to point to the newly created Element object.
this._length = arr.length; - This line updates the _length property of the List object to the length of the arr array.

add(element) { - This is a method that adds a new Element object to the beginning of the linked list. It takes a single argument, element, which is the new Element object to add.
if (this._head === null) { - This line checks if the _head property of the linked list is null. If it is, we set the _head property to the new Element object.
this._head = element; - This line sets the _head property of the linked list to the new Element object.
element._next = this._head; - This line sets the next property of the new Element object to the current _head of the linked list.
this._head = element; - This line sets the _head property of the linked listto the new Element object.
this._length++; - This line increments the _length property of the linked list to reflect the addition of the new Element object.

get length() { - This is a getter method that returns the length of the linked list.
get head() { - This is a getter method that returns the _head property of the linked list.
toArray() { - This is a method that converts the linked list to an array of values.
let arr = []; - This line creates a new empty array that we will use to store the values of the linked list.
let current = this._head; - This line creates a new variable called current and sets it to the _head of the linked list.
while (current !== null) { - This line starts a loop that iterates over all the elements in the linked list.
arr.push(current.value); - This line adds the value of the current Element object to the arr array.
current = current.next; - This line updates the current variable to point to the next Element object in the linked list.
return arr; - This line returns the arr array of values.
reverse() { - This is a method that reverses the order of the elements in the linked list.
let current = this._head; - This line creates a new variable called current and sets it to the _head of the linked list.
let previous = null; - This line creates a new variable called previous and sets it to null.
while (current !== null) { - This line starts a loop that iterates over all the elements in the linked list.
let next = current.next; - This line creates a new variable called next and sets it to the next property of the current Element object.
current.next = previous; - This line sets the next property of the current Element object to the previous variable.
previous = current; - This line updates the previous variable to point to the current Element object.
current = next; - This line updates the current variable to point to the next Element object in the linked list.
this._head = previous; - This line sets the _head property of the linked list to the last Element object in the original linked list, which is now the first Element object in the reversed linked list.
return this; - This line returns the List object, which now represents the reversed linked list.
